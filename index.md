# Welcome to [www.mentalhealthmarin.com](http://www.mentalhealthmarin.com/)

Hi there! I'm Rashi King Abramson. I've struggled with finding mental health resources in Marin County and want to put them all in one place. If you know of a resource that I should add, email me: [roshkins@gmail.com](mailto:roshkins@gmail.com). You can also [edit it directly and issue a pull request](https://github.com/roshkins/mentalhealthmarin/edit/master/index.md) if you know what that is or what that means.

## BHRS Access Line [(888) 818-1115](tel:+18888181115)
This is the first step you should take if you need mental health services. If you have private insurance, Y=you may get services more quickly if you look at the back of your insurance card and call the 24/7 nurseline or similar that is listed. Otherwise, the Access Line can help you locate resources through your insurance and through the county. 

8am-5pm is when someone is available to pickup the phone immediately.
Answering service between 5pm to 8am, but there is always someone available to respond day or night. I got this information by calling the Access Line.


## Crisis Stabilization Unit [(415) 473-6666](tel:+14154736666)

This was formerly called Psychiatric Emergency Services. This is a physical location at Marin General. Use this if you are in crisis and need therapy or other support now. They can help over the phone or in person. From my own experience, this is better than showing up to the emergency room. 

## National Suicide Prevention Lifeline [(800) 273-8255](tel:+1800273-8255)

If you are feeling suicidal, they may be able to offer some help for this moment.

## Traffic Court – Community Service Work [(415) 444-7180](tel:+14154447180)
To inquire about eligibility for community service work, individuals must come to the Traffic Clerk’s Office to complete a declaration regarding their household size and income. If it is determined that they are eligible to perform community service work, the clerk will provide information on how to get started.

Can't afford your traffic ticket? At the Superior Court of California in the County of Marin, you may be eligible to perform community service work instead of paying your traffic ticket if you meet certain financial qualifications. The cost of your traffic ticket is converted to community service work at a rate of $10 per hour. For example, a $250 citation can be converted to 25 hours of community service work ($250 divided by $10 per hour equals 25 hours.) 

**Important**:
"Community service work registration can be done without going to court. There is a $50 administrative fee which must be paid at the time of registration. When registering for community service work, the Court will determine the deadline for completion of the hours. **If the hours are not completed, or the completed and signed timesheet is not turned in to the Court by the due date**, the community service hours will be automatically converted back to bail or a monetary fine, the case will be sent to court collections, **the amount owed will be increased by a $300 civil assessment and other monetary sanctions, and the violator’s driving privileges may be affected.**"
